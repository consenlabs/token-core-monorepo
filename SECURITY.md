## Bounty Scope
TokenCore Bug Bounty is only based on TokenCore open-sourced code, the GitHub repository is https://github.com/consenlabs/token-core.

The following are what we are interested in:

- Vulnerabilities that can steal assets or cause loss of assets
- Defects in core encryption algorithm implementation, such as Keystore, Wallet Generation, Transaction Signature, etc.
- Vulnerabilities in chain-related logic code
- Vulnerabilities in the wallet application layer
- Vulnerabilities that can cause software unavailability, such as App crashes, etc.
- Insecure and irregular code implementations
- Vulnerability messages for third-party libraries

The following are out of scope:

- Anything that isnâ€™t in this repository
- 3rd party library dependencies
- Example code for demonstrating 

Please also note that any bugs already reported are considered out of scope.

## Severity and rewards
The severity of reported vulnerabilities will be graded according to CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard, https://www.first.org/cvss). The following table will serve as a guideline for reward decisions:

| Vulnerability Tier         | Reward            |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Critical (CVSS 9.0 - 10.0) | 5000 - 10000 USDT |
| High (CVSS 6.0 - 8.9)      | 1000 - 5000 USDT  |
| Medium (CVSS 4.0 - 5.9)    | 500 - 1000 USDT   |
| Low (CVSS 0.1 - 3.9)       | 0 - 500 USDT      |

The reward we pay is in [Tether USD token](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7) on ethereum, so please prepare your ethereum wallet address in advance.
